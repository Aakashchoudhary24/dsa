# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Purpose

This repository is my daily effort to stay consistent with Data Structures and Algorithms. No matter how good your development skills are, DSA is still a gatekeeper for most exams and interviews â€” so this is my way of making sure I don't get rejected just because of DSA.


## Aim

- Practice at least one question/concept every day.
- Build a strong foundation and learn real case uses and not just mug up for interviews.
- Organize everything neatly by topic.
